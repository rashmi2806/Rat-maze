# Rat-maze

This project visualizes the "Rat in a Maze" problem, where a rat navigates through a maze from a starting point to a destination while avoiding walls. The application is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Configurable maze size (N) and number of blocked nodes.
- Start, pause, and restart functionalities for the rat's movement.
- Visualization of the rat's path and walls.
- Victory message upon reaching the destination.
- 2-second delay for each move for better visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Adjust the maze size and number of blocked nodes.
4. Click "Start" to begin the simulation.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

## Good to Have

- The logic can be expanded to support 3D matrices, but the current implementation focuses on 2D.

## Development

Feel free to contribute to the project or submit issues for improvements or bugs.
